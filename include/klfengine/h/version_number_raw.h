//
// This file will be included by the C++ library, but it will also be parsed by
// the build scripts to avoid redundancy in the version descriptions.  So do NOT
// add any preprocessor magic or anything like that here.  Simply leave these
// four definitions as they are updating their values as necessary.  Any
// additional auxiliary helpers (e.g. stringified versions) should be defined in
// <klfengine/h/version.h>.
//
// All lines in this file must start with "//" or "#define".  Major, minor,
// release parts of the versions are integers.  The suffix can be any
// (double-quoted) C string literal (like "beta3").
